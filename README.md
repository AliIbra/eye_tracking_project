# eye_tracking_project

**Overview**

This repository contains a report on an experiment utilizing eye-tracking data from a subset of the VEEER VR Eyes: Emotions Dataset (VREED). The experiment aims to investigate number of blinks and fixation duration patterns in respect to emotional responses in a virtual reality (VR) environment.

**Dataset**

VEEER VR Eyes: Emotions Dataset (VREED) is a dataset designed for studying eye movements and emotional expressions in VR settings. This experiment used a subset of VREED, focusing on participants exposed to controlled emotional stimuli.
